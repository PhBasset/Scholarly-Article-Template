<h1 data-label="874460" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Triboelectric energy harvesters typically generate high AC open-circuit voltage of several hundred volts peak, with realtively low short-circuit current from a few to tens of µA peak. On the other side, most applications request input DC voltages around a few volts with  associated DC current in the mA range, in order to provide a minimum of mean power of 100 µW, like for a Bluetooth Low Energy communication for instance. Then, the conditioning electronic of TENG is of important matter and have generate a lot of attention recently. </div><div> Triboelectric energy harvesters   typically generate a large open circuit AC voltage of several hundred volts peak, with a relatively low short-circuit current of a few tens of µA peak maximum. On the other hand, most applications require DC input voltages of the order of a few volts with an associated DC current in t mA, in order to provide a minimum average power of 100 µW, as for low power consumption Bluetooth communication for example. The conditioning electronics of the TENG is therefore an important subject and has recently attracted a lot of attention.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Translated with <a href="http://www.DeepL.com/Translator">www.DeepL.com/Translator</a> (free version)</div><div></div>
