<h1 data-label="874460" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Triboelectric energy harvesters typically generate high AC open-circuit voltage of several hundred volts peak, with relatively low short-circuit current  of a few tens of µA peak maximum  . On the other side, most applications  require DC input voltages around a few volts with an associated DC   current in the mA range, in order to provide a minimum  average   power of 100 µW, like for a Bluetooth Low Energy communication for instance.  The conditioning electronics of the TENG is therefore an important subject and has recently attracted a lot of attention.&nbsp;  &nbsp;</div><div> If  AC voltage is good enough for the targetted application, output power optimization is obtained by equalizing the realload impedance with the real part of the mechanical impedance of the TENG</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Translated with <a href="http://www.DeepL.com/Translator">www.DeepL.com/Translator</a> (free version)</div><div></div>
