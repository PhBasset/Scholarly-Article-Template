<h1 data-label="874460" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Triboelectric energy harvesters typically generate high AC open-circuit voltage of several hundred volts peak, with realtively low short-circuit current of a few ÂµA peak. On the other side, most applications request input DC voltages around a few volts with a associated current&nbsp;</div><div></div>
