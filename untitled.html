<h1 data-label="874460" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Triboelectric energy harvesters typically generate high AC open-circuit voltage of several hundred volts peak, with relatively low short-circuit current  of a few tens of µA peak maximum  . On the other side, most applications request input DC voltages around a few volts with  associated DC current in the mA range, in order to provide a minimum of mean power of 100 µW, like for a Bluetooth Low Energy communication for instance.  The conditioning electronics of the TENG is therefore an important subject and has recently attracted a lot of attention.&nbsp;  &nbsp;</div><div> Triboelectric energy harvesters   typically generate a large open circuit AC voltage of several hundred volts peak, with a relatively low short-circuit current of a few tens of µA peak maximum.
